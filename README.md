# Spotify Song Recommendation System

### Description
This project involves using a content-based filtering recommendation system made in Python to find new songs for a music playlist.

### Aim
The main goal of this project is to expand a small Reggae/RnB music playlist I made in Spotify and populate it with at least 50 similar-sounding songs to create a healthy selection of music from the genre. Reggae music is quite foreign to me and I wanted a more convenient way to explore the genre, so I decided to gather some old-school RnB and upbeat Reggae songs I knew and put them all in a small playlist, and then try to use the playlist to generate some enjoyable song recommendations.
